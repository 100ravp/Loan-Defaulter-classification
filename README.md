LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

In this projects I have done some EDA in order to identify hidden patterns which is followed by data cleaning and data pre-processing, thereafter I have run various algorithms like artificial Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest.
